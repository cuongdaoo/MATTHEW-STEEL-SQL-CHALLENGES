## About the Challenges

Matthew Steel's SQL challenges are a treasure trove of data exploration and manipulation puzzles. Each challenge presents a unique scenario, from querying complex data structures to deriving meaningful insights from real-world datasets. With a focus on practical application, these challenges are an excellent way to sharpen your SQL proficiency and delve into the art of data analysis.

## Techniques
Here are the techniques I have used:

### 1. **Using Aggregate Functions:**
You have utilized aggregate functions to perform calculations on data, such as `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `ROUND()`.

### 2. **Grouping Data with `GROUP BY`:**
You frequently grouped records based on one or more columns and combined them with aggregate functions.

### 3. **Using `JOIN` to Combine Data from Multiple Tables:**
You employed `INNER JOIN` to connect different tables based on common key columns, such as `customer_id`, `team_id`, and `salesman_id`.

### 4. **Sorting Data with `ORDER BY`:**
You applied `ORDER BY` to sort the results in ascending or descending order.

### 5. **Applying Conditions with `WHERE` and `HAVING`:**
You used `WHERE` to filter data based on specific conditions and `HAVING` to filter data after grouping (`GROUP BY`).

### 6. **Utilizing Window Functions:**
You applied window functions to calculate data without grouping the results, specifically using `OVER()`.

### 7. **Limiting Results with `TOP` or `LIMIT`:**
You used `TOP` to restrict the number of records returned.

### 8. **Using `DISTINCT` to Remove Duplicate Values:**
You employed `DISTINCT` to retrieve only unique values.

### 9. **Combining Conditions with `AND` and `OR`:**
You combined logical conditions using `AND` and `OR` within the `WHERE` clause.

### 10. **Filtering Data by Year with `YEAR()`:**
You used the `YEAR()` function to extract and compare the year from date columns.
